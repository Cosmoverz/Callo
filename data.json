I also changed some gradient colors, icons, backgrounds, and many others. I am also going to constantly update the Github repo, so you could see the new features coming!\n\nThanks,\nCooli",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nI have looked at this website, I love it, but there was just one problem. That problem was just that there was too many complicated parts to be portfolio as I call it. All I need was a one-page website, with nice and smooth animations. I worked on it and put all my effort to it. I finally got what I needed, but yes it did take some time to make it as you see it currently. The new website is Colio, and it is my new portfolio. This website is Callo, and it became where I write my blog posts, and a bit of my reviews ;) If you want to see the live code of my other website and this, just head over to the github page which is https://github.com/Spacesters?tab=repositories.\n\nThank you for reading,\nCooli",
